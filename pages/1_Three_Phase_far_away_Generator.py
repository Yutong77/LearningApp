                       Let's first assume that the transmission line is purely inductive with no resistance,
                       i.e. $\theta=\pi/2$. 
                       Since we are primarily interested in the worst scenario,
                       which leads to the largest fault current, 
                       we choose the voltage source angle at the occurrence of the short circuit to be $\alpha=(\theta-\pi/2)$.\
                       Because the three phases of the system are symmetrical, 
                       for simplicity, the short-circuit current of only one phase is presented. 
                       Moreover we assume that the system is operating under no-load condition. The corresponding short circuit current plot is shown below.

                    The AC fault current (also called steady-state fault current), is a sinusoid and equal in amplitude.
                    The DC offset current, decays exponentially with time constant T=L/R. 
                    It appears because the current on the inductor cannot change abruptly.
