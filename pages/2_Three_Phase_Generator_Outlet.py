                   Because the short-circuit current is mainly influenced by the generator d-axis reactance, 
                   $\theta$ is selected as $\pi/2$ here. 
                   Same as for the case far away generator, 
                   $\alpha$ is primarily chosen to be $\alpha=(\theta-\pi/2)$ at the occurrence of the short circuit. 
                   The fault current in one phase of an unloaded synchronous machine 
                   during a three-phase short circuit is shown below.

            Similar to the case of a short circuit far away from the generator, 
            the short circuit current also consists of a DC component and an AC component. 
            The difference is that the AC component no longer oscillates with equal amplitude, 
            but decays before converging to a steady state value. 
            '''
            r'''
            To figure out why the AC component oscillates in this way,

                    The decaying AC component has three periods, from subtransient to transient eventually reaching steady state. 
                    The initial period of decay of the short-circuit current is called the subtrasient period 
                    in which the current decay is governed mainly by the d-axis short-circuit subtransient time constant $T_d^{"}$. 
                    At a later time, when *t* is larger than $T_d^{"}$, the first term has decayed almost to zero, 
                    the current continues to decay governed by a relatively large time constant, 
                    namely the d-axis short-circuit transient time constant $T_d^{'}$. 
                    This period of the short-circuit current is called the transient period. 
                    When *t* is much larger than $T_d^{'}$, the AC current approaches its steady-state value. 
                    The currents can be written as follows.

                    The appearance of DC offset current is due to the fact that 
                    the flux linkages of each stator phase cannot change instantaneously. 
                    The current is proportional to the flux linkages at the instant of short-circuit 
                    and then decays with armature time constant $T_A$.

                   r'''
                    The magnetic flux induced by the short-circuit armature currents is 
                    initially forced to flow through high reluctance paths 
                    that are not linked to the field winding or damper circuits of the generator. 
                    The armature inductance, which is inversely proportional to reluctance, is therefore initially low. 
                    As the flux then moves toward the lower reluctance paths, the armature inductance increases.

            All we study now are symmetrical faults, 
            they may result in severe consequences but do not occur as often as asymmetrical faults, 
            for example single-phase to ground fault. 
            It is very complicated to study asymmetric faults directly, 
            therefore the symmetric component decomposition method is introduced.
